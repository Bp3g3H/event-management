### üêò Option 1: Using Docker with Laravel Sail (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Bp3g3H/event-management.git
    cd event-management
    ```

2. **Copy and configure your environment**

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit the `.env` file to set your database credentials and other environment variables as needed.

    ```

5. **Run migrations**

    ```

    > **Note:** This will also create a default admin user if you have set `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file.

6. **(Optional) Seed additional data**

    ```sh
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed
